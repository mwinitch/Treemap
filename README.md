# Treemap for Board Game Categories

This project uses the D3 JavaScript library to create a treemap showing the various frequencies of different board game categories. The data came from BoardGameGeek and the link to all the possible board game categories can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamecategory "Categories").

In the dataset `categories.csv` there is the following line:
```
Origin,,
```
This is simply for D3 to help construct the treemap and is not a part of the board game category data itself.
